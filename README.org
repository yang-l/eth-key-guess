#+TITLE: Guess A Ethereum Private Key and Check the Balance

(Do not take this fun project too seriously)

The silly purpose of this small code it to randomly generate an Ethereum key and check its balanced to with etherscan.

Note that it would probably take billion of billion years to get a valid private key, and would be much more easier to win two top lottery in a row then this.
